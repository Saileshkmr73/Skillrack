"""
Given a sequence of distinct numbers a1, a2, â€¦. an, an inversion occurs if there are indices i < j such that ai > aj.

For example, in the sequence 2 1 4 3 there are 2 inversions (2 1) and (4 3).

 
The input will be a main sequence of N positive integers. From this sequence, a Derived sequence will be obtained using the following rule. The output is the number of inversions in the derived sequence.

Rule for forming the derived sequence:

The derived sequence is formed by the sum of digits in the base 6 representation of the corresponding number in the input sequence.

Thus for the number 1409, the base 6 representation is 10305, and the sum of digits is 1+0+3+0+5 = 9. The sum of digits may be done in the decimal system, and does not need to be in base 6.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^7


 
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a comma.

Output Format:
The first line contains the number of inversions in the derived sequence formed from the main sequence.
